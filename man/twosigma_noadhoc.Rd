\usage{
twosigma_noadhoc(count, mean_covar, zi_covar, mean_re = TRUE,
  zi_re = TRUE, id, disp_covar = NULL, weights = rep(1,
  length(count)), control = glmmTMBControl())
}
\arguments{
\item{count}{Vector of non-negative integer read counts. If specifying custom formula(s) via the arguments mean_form and zi_form the expression in mean_form will supersede.}

\item{mean_covar}{Covariates for the (conditional) mean model. Must be a matrix (without an intercept column) or = 1 to indicate an intercept only model.}

\item{zi_covar}{Covariates for the zero-inflation model. Must be a matrix (without an intercept column), = 1 to indicate an intercept only model, or = 0 to indicate no zero-inflation model desired.}

\item{mean_re}{Should random intercepts be included in the (conditional) mean model?}

\item{zi_re}{Should random intercepts be included in the zero-inflation model?}

\item{id}{Vector of individual-level ID's. Used for random effect prediction.}

\item{disp_covar}{Covariates for a log-linear model for the dispersion. Either a matrix of covariates or = 1 to indicate an intercept only model. Random effect terms are not permitted in the dispersion model.}

\item{weights}{weights, as in glm. Defaults to 1 for all observations and no scaling or centering of weights is performed.}

\item{control}{Control parameters for optimization in \code{glmmTMB}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{glmmTMB}. See Details for a note about the estimated overdispersion parameter.

\section{Details}{
 Note that the overdispersion estimate returned is the inverse of phi in the parameterization used in TWO-SIGMA.  See ?nbinom2
